## FAQ

### How does it work ?
Every item is internally ranked using a tier list. If you increase the item luck, items higher on the tier list will be more likely to spawn. If you decrease the item luck, items lower on the tier list will be more likely to spawn.

You can configure the item luck and the item ranks in the settings (`Settings > Mod options > ItemLuck`)

### What is the default tier list ?
The tier list is defined [here](https://github.com/Lawlzee/ItemLuck/blob/master/DefaultTierList.cs).

Disclaimer:
The default tier list not perfect. It is based on my experience as an E8 player with ~500 hours who doesn't play with lunar items. Feel free to change it in the settings.

### Does the mod work with modded items ?
Yes. They will have the rank `Unspecified` by default. You can change the rank in the settings.
